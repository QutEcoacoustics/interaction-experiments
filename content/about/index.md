title: About these experiments
---

The QUT Ecoacoustics research group has many ideas that are best tested over the internet
with many pariticpants.

In the past we have had to create a new web site for every experiment. Hopefully this
platform will make the process easier by hosting many different experiments using
standard, open, and reusable components.

The source code for these experiments is available in the 
[QutEcoacoustics/interaction-experiments](https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/interaction-experiments)
<i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub repository.

All data collection adheres to [QUT data collection policies](http://www.mopp.qut.edu.au/D/D_02_08.jsp)
and additionally and specific requirments of each expeirment's ethics agreement. 
Each experiment is required to have an ethics agreement before data is collected,
and is also required to show an ethics cover letter before the experiment begins.

If you have any concerns about the experiments, notice any mistakes, or want information
about the experiment in general, then you can:

- File an issue in the GitHub repository
- Use the contact form below
- Use the contact information found in the ethics cover letter for each experiment
- Or, for serious issues, contact [QUT's Office of Ethics and Integirty](https://www.qut.edu.au/research/why-qut/ethics-and-integrity) directly
